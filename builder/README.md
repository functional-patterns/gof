# Builder

## Intent

Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations. 

## Conclusion
In functional programming the builder is a function, which is parameterized with functions to perform each step of the build process. There is no real difference between Template Method, which also is parameterized with functions to perform the steps.

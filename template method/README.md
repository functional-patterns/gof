# Template Method


## Intent

Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.


## Conclusion

Template Method is one of the simplest object-oriented design patterns to be implemented in pure functional way. Essentially it is just a simple function composition.

Compared to object-oriented version the functional version is way shorter.


## Examples

[F#](template_method.fsx)

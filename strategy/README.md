# Strategy


## Intent

Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it. 


## Conclusion

In functional programming strategy is just a family of functions having the same signature and conceptually performing the same kind of task (like compressing data or sorting items).


## Examples

[F#](strategy.fsx)

/// MEMENTO
/// 
/// Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object's internal state so that the
/// object can be restored to this state later.
/// 

///
/// CONCLUSION
/// 
/// State is only meaningful in the impure part of a functional program. Undo/Redo functionality 
/// can be achieved simply by creating a stack of the "states" of the program.

# Facade


## Intent

Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.


## Conclusion

In functional programming natural way to implement Facade is to use function composition. This way a low level or otherwise difficult to use interface may be turned to more abstract and easy to understand interface.

If only one single function is converted behind the Facade, then the parttern is similar with functional Adapter.


## Examples

[F#](facade.fsx)

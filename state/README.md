# State

Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.


## Conclusion

Functional programming is stateless. It should be no surprise that State design pattern is not well fitted to functional programming.

State machines, state monads and folds may be used to manage states in functional programming. However, none of these feel well suited to address the original intent of the design pattern.


## Examples

[F#](state.fsx)

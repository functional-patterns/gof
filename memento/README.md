### Intent

Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object's internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later.


### Conclusion

State - as meant in the intent of the pattern - is not a meaningful concept in pure functional code. Despite during a function execution the stack states could be generated, this does not capture the original idea of the pattern.

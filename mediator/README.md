# Mediator


## Intent

Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, and it lets you vary their interaction independently. 


## Conclusion

In pure functional programming there is no interaction between data. Intent of the Mediator
design pattern does not apply to functional programming.

/// SINGLETON
/// 
/// Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it. 
///

///
/// CONCLUSION
/// 
/// Functional programming contains only immutable data and functions. Neither of these can be
/// modified. The concept of having "single instance" is not meaningful in pure functional context.

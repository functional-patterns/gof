# Proxy

Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.


## Conclusion

Haskell offers lazy map; which may be used to implement memoization. In this way the proxy can be used to memorize the return values for any given parameters.

Functional programs often feature lazy evaluation. In this sense the possibly expensive computation is deferred later. This is one feature the object oriented counterpart offers.

Design pattern is useful also in data hiding, like it was in object-oriented version.


## Examples

[F#](proxy.fsx)

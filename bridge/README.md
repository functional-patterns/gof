# Bridge

## Intent

Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.


## Conclusion
 
Bridge pattern has a different form in functional than in object-oriented programming. However, the same idea may be used to totally separate the abstraction from the implementation.

## Examples

[F#](bridge.fsx)
